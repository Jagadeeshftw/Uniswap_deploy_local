# Uniswap V2 Local Deployment with Foundry

This repository provides a guide to deploy Uniswap locally for testing and development purposes using **Foundry**, a fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum applications.

## Features

- Deploy Uniswap V2 contracts locally using Foundry
- Create trading pairs and liquidity pools
- Perform swaps, add/remove liquidity
- Test Uniswap functionality with Solidity-based tests in Foundry
- Customizable token deployment for testing different scenarios

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Foundry**: Install Foundry by following the [Foundry installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html).
- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed on your machine [Git download](https://git-scm.com/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jagadeeshftw/Uniswap_deploy_local.git
   cd Uniswap_deploy_local
   ```

2. **Install Foundry**:
   If Foundry is not installed yet, run:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   ```

3. **Compile the contracts**:
   Compile the Uniswap V2 contracts and other contracts using Foundry:
   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

### Deploying Uniswap Locally

1. **Start a Local Ethereum Node**:
   You can use tools like Anvil (included with Foundry) to spin up a local Ethereum node:
   ```bash
   anvil
   ```

2. **Deploy Uniswap Contracts**:
   Deploy the Uniswap smart contracts to the local network using a Foundry script:
   ```bash
   forge script script/UniswapDeployer.s.sol --fork-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
   ```

   This script will deploy:
   - Uniswap V2 Factory
   - Uniswap V2 Router
   - Sample tokens for testing (e.g., WETH, DAI, USDC)

3. **Output**:
   After deployment, you will get contract addresses for the factory, router, and tokens. Save these addresses for interacting with Uniswap later.

### Generating the Init Code Hash for Uniswap V2 Pair

Before running `forge test`, follow these steps to get the `init_code_hash` for Uniswap V2 Pair:

1. **Get the Bytecode**:
   Navigate to the following path to find the Uniswap V2 Pair contract's deployment bytecode:
   ```
   Uniswap_deploy_local/out/UniswapV2Pair.sol/UniswapV2Pair.json
   ```

2. **Generate the Init Code Hash**:
   1. Copy the deployment bytecode from the above JSON file.
   2. Visit [this online Keccak-256 tool](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html).
   3. Paste the copied bytecode into the tool.
   4. Ensure the input type is set to "hex" (not "text").
   5. The output will be the `keccak256` hash of the bytecode, which will serve as your `init_code_hash`.

3. **Update the Init Code Hash**:
   Replace the static `init_code_hash` in the `pairFor` function (in `UniswapV2Library`) with the newly generated hash before running the tests.

### Usage

#### Interacting with the Contracts

You can interact with the deployed contracts using Foundryâ€™s Solidity scripts or through the console.

### Testing

This repository includes Solidity-based tests that verify the Uniswap deployment. Run the tests using Foundry:

```bash
forge test
```

### Folder Structure

- `contracts/`: Contains the Uniswap V2 contracts and additional token contracts for testing.
- `script/`: Deployment and interaction scripts using Foundry.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests to verify Uniswap functionality.
- `out/`: Compiled contracts and metadata (generated by Foundry).
